# Blades-Of-Equestria
Isometric Pony CRPG

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/hamish0529/hamish/_apis/build/status/hamish-milne.Blades-Of-Equestria?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/hamish0529/hamish/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master)

To get the latest build, do the following:

* Make sure you've got [LOVE](https://love2d.org/) installed (works on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android)
* Click the badge above
* Go to Summary
* Click '...' next to the Job archive
* View Contents
* Expand Job, click BoE-*-.love, then '...'
* Download, and open

(I hope to replace this with some javascript soon)

NB that actual releases will bundle the LOVE binary into a nice little executable with an icon and everything.
